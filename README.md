# KEMA-GCMA-hydrogel
  
This is a set of code that can:    
* Fast create methacrylated-keratin / methacrylated-glycol chitosan hydrogel model under desire concentration.  
* Output standard LAMMPS input code to perform stable equilibirum.   
* Polymerize methacrylate sidechain based on [Polymatic](https://nanohub.org/resources/17278).

## Quick start
Several softwares are available and should be installed and set as enviormental varibles:  
* [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD)
